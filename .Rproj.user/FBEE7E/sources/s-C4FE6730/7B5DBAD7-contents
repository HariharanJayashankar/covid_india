# Estimating the Effective Reproduction Number for Covid-19 in India - By State

This repo attempts to estimate the effective reproduction number (R) of India.

The numbers have to interpretted with some care. Only if we assume testing rates are similar across states, we can comment on whether a state with a higher R is doing worse than a state with a lower one. But not matter what, a high R is worrying. For example, most epidemiological models predict that for a disease to stop spreading R should be lower than 1. Presumeably this is when we can think of lifting lockdowns.
